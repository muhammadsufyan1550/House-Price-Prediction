# Task : House Price Prediction using California Housing Dataset

## 📋 Project Overview
This project builds machine learning models to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset. Multiple regression algorithms are implemented and compared to find the best performing model for real estate price prediction. This is part of an AI/ML internship program focusing on regression modeling and predictive analytics.

## 🎯 Objective
Build and evaluate regression models to predict house prices based on property features such as:
- Location characteristics (crime rate, proximity to river)
- Property features (number of rooms, age of building)
- Neighborhood factors (tax rates, pupil-teacher ratio)
- Environmental factors (pollution levels, accessibility)

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Dataset**: California Housing Dataset
- **Source**: Built-in dataset from scikit-learn library
- **Format**: Structured tabular data
- **Size**: 20,640 samples, 8 features, 1 target variable

## 🏠 Business Applications
This model can be used for:
- **Real Estate Valuation**: Automated property price estimation in California
- **Investment Analysis**: Identifying undervalued properties across CA regions
- **Market Research**: Understanding price-driving factors in different CA areas
- **Geographic Analysis**: Studying regional price variations across California

## 📝 Conclusion
The California house price prediction analysis demonstrates that machine learning models can effectively predict real estate prices using demographic, geographic, and property characteristics. Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models showed superior performance compared to Linear Regression, with tree-based models better capturing non-linear relationships in the housing market.

Key insights reveal that median income (MedInc) and geographic location (Latitude/Longitude) are primary drivers of house prices in California, with coastal areas commanding premium prices.
